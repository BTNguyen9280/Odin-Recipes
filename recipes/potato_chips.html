    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe will show you a simple and easy way to make a delicious batch of <strong>homestyle potato chips</strong>!</p>
    <p>Homemade potato chips are fun and easy. Guaranteed they won't last long! A food processor with a slicing attachment is very helpful for slicing the potatoes. Experiment with the thickness; you may like them thicker or thinner. I like to use olive oil for frying, but you can use safflower, corn, or peanut oil as well as vegetable oil.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 medium potatoes, peeled and sliced <em>paper-thin</em></li>
        <li>3 tablespoons salt or favorite seasoning</li>
        <li>1 quart oil for deep frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and slice potatoes paper-thin, transferring to a bowl of cold water as you slice them.</li>
        <li>Drain slices and rinse under cold water. Refill bowl with water, add 3 tablespoons of salt, and put slices back in bowl.</li>
        <li>Let the sliced potatoes soak in salty water for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain and rinces slices again. Pat dry.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Working in small batches, fry until golden.</li>
        <li>Season potato chips with your favorite seasoning as soon as they are removed from the oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy!</strong></li>
